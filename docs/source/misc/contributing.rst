We welcome contributions to the particlerouting package. To contribute, we ask that pull requests be made to the `develop` branch on GitHub. Feel free to open up an issue beforehand to discuss the planned addition or modification.

As much as possible we try to stick to the `PEP-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ standards for our code and `PEP-257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ standards for our docstrings.
