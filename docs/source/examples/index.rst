Examples of the high-level API functionality are provided here. These examples range from simple particle routing with a flow field, to measuring exposure time distributions for particle transport in a specified region. If your use case extends beyond the scenarios explored in these examples, we recommend using the `routines.py` script to help you design your own functions based on the lower-level methods in `particle_track.py`.
